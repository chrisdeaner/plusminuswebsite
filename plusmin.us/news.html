if you happen to live in taiwan, check out our <em>you are here/holding patterns</em> double cd available on <a href="http://www.wwr.idv.tw/">white wabbit records</a>. it combines the japanese version of <em>you are here</em> and the us version of <em>holding patterns</em> into one glorious affair. my favorite release so far... <br>

        <br>
not only does wicker park have the aforementioned website, there will also be a <a href="http://www.lakeshore-records.com/wickerpark/index.html">soundtrack on lakeshore records</a> coming out this fall. other artists on the soundtrack include death cab for cutie, the postal service, snow patrol, broken social scene, the shins, mates of state, mum, and mogwai. sounds rather fine indeed! <br>

        cold. you call something the warm tour - it's not that warm (except of 
        course for 2 brilliant days in south florida).<br>
        <br>
        it was however an extremely fun jaunt and we thank those who came to see 
        us (especially in those towns where we've never been before). the tour 
        left us wondering why bands hardly ever make it to florida. in my 8 years 
        of touring, i've only gone to florida 3 times... most bands skip the state 
        entirely. i'm gonna step up and say it was a beautiful time - especially 
        in the winter.<br>
        <br>
        we did also resolve some controversy - there seem to be those who think 
        that in a turducken, the duck is the smallest bird and should therefore 
        be inserted into the chicken. not so acording to <a href="http://www.chefpaul.com/turducken.html">paul 
        prudhomme's recipe</a> ...<br>
