        record release show at mercury lounge on october 18, 2003. if you can 
        only catch one show this fall, this is definitely the one! we'll be selling 
        'you are here' and if you buy it - you'll get an additional cd single 
        of 'walk in a straight line' which is definitely one of our favorite songs 
        that just didn't seem to fit this 1.0 version of the album. so we hope 
        to see you all there - it should be loads of theoretical fun.<br>

        our fall and winter tours are shaping up. the fall tour - dubbed the cold 
        tour - will be a short jaunt down the east coast and then up into the 
        midwest. the winter tour - dubbed the warm tour - will be a short jaunt 
        down into balmy florida for a bit of december warmth. check back for details.<br>

        oh, and if you haven't heard them yet, we have some tracks from the new

        we're just about to head out on the warm tour - and if you live in one 
        of these nice towns, please come out and check out the show.<br>
        <br>
        in the meantime, we've posted <span class="emphasis">more reviews and 
        features</span> on the <a href="./press.htmll">press</a> page - i especially 
        like the review that begins, "james baluyut is one creepy motherfucker." 
        - not sure if my mom would, but the reviewer ends up giving 4/4 stars 
        so i guess it's cool right? <br>
        <br>
        oh and we've posted our <span class="emphasis">videos</span> for "trapped 
        under ice floes" and "she's got your eyes" on the <a href="./listen.htmll">listen</a> 
        page. check out the theoretical av stylings of chris deaner.<br>

					<tr><td colspan="2"><div class="genericItem">funny how life works... you call something the cold tour - it's not that 
        cold. you call something the warm tour - it's not that warm (except of 
        course for 2 brilliant days in south florida).<br>
        <br>
        it was however an extremely fun jaunt and we thank those who came to see 
        us (especially in those towns where we've never been before). the tour 
        left us wondering why bands hardly ever make it to florida. in my 8 years 
        of touring, i've only gone to florida 3 times... most bands skip the state 
        entirely. i'm gonna step up and say it was a beautiful time - especially 
        in the winter.<br>
        <br>
        we did also resolve some controversy - there seem to be those who think 
        that in a turducken, the duck is the smallest bird and should therefore 
        be inserted into the chicken. not so acording to <a href="http://www.chefpaul.com/turducken.htmll">paul 
        prudhomme's recipe</a> ...<br>
        <br>
        finally, check out the videos on the <a href="./listen.htmll">listen</a> 
        page (yeah yeah...) by in house video artiste chris deaner. they're kinda 
        big, so we recommend some sort of fast connection.<br>
        <br>
        thanks for your support - we'll see you soon.<br>
