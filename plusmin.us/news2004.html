        2. +/- (pronounced plus minus) will also have a track (entitled <a href="./lyrics.htmll#walkinastraightline">"walk 
        in a straight line"</a>) on the upcoming teenbeat sampler 2004, which 
        should be out on the first of march. it's one of our favorites - and it 
        features the lovely pipes of margaret mccartney.<br>

        park</a>, a tale of loss and obsession coming to theaters this fall. apparently, 
        this is a remake of a french film entitled <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115561/">l'appartment</a>

pretty quiet around here huh? well, that's because we're trying to write new material and we need the silence for total concentration. but still, we do have some things to report.<br>

we're playing a show in NYC in august! so if you live close, or you're planning a trip to 'la grande pomme', you should definitely check it out. details above. we'd love to see you!<br>

oh and the film <span class="emphasis">wicker park</span> has a website. <a href="http://wickerparkmovie.com/">look here</a>. if you click on gallery you can hear the faint murmur of 'all i do' from self-titled long playing debut album. apparently, it's used numerous times as the 'film love theme'. <br>
        <br>
not only does wicker park have the aforementioned website, there will also be a <a href="http://www.lakeshore-records.com/wickerpark/index.htmll">soundtrack on lakeshore records</a> coming out this fall. other artists on the soundtrack include death cab for cutie, the postal service, snow patrol, broken social scene, the shins, mates of state, mum, and mogwai. sounds rather fine indeed! <br>

if you happen to live in taiwan, check out our <em>you are here/holding patterns</em> double cd available on <a href="http://www.wwr.idv.tw/">white wabbit records</a>. it combines the japanese version of <em>you are here</em> and the us version of <em>holding patterns</em> into one glorious affair. my favorite release so far... <br>
