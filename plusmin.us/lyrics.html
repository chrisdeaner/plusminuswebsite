			<br>
			All of a sudden I am flying in a plane<br>
			I Beeline to michigan when new york is insane<br>
			I realign my head because there's nothing else to do<br>
			I drink coffee to divine why I am so confused <br>
			<br>
			And then I found myself walking with the queen of detroit<br>
			An audience with someone whose life I have not destroyed <br>
			<br>
			You're dealing with a kid that doesn't have a clue<br>
			That chasing you around is not the thing to do <br>
			<br>
			And then I found myself walking with the queen of detroit<br>
			An audience with someone whose life I have not destroyed<br>
			But give me time and I can mess up anything at all<br>
			And I'll be fine after I take advantage of your fall.<br>

			There's something I left back there at beverley road<br>
			There's something I missed, sometimes it's just hard to know<br>
			If anything's left you can assume it's not mine<br>
			There's just one more thing I don't want to leave behind <br>
			<br>
			Please don't let me throw everything away<br>
			The salvation army doesn't bring anything back again <br>
			<br>
			You want to remove every trace I had been<br>
			I'll have one more look before your new life moves on in<br>
			If anything's left you can assume it's not mine<br>
			There's just one more thing… something I see in your eye <br>
			<br>
			Please don't let me throw everything away<br>
			The salvation army doesn't bring anything back again<br>
			To you.<br>

			Right things to do but I just don't <br>

			But I know that I was a fool<br>
			And you deserve someone new <br>

			I know I said the wrong things to you, dear. <br>

			After all the pain is done<br>
			She reaches into her nightgown<br>
			She curls herself into a ball <br>
			<br>
			She sleeps forever like a bear<br>
			Because she knows there's no one there<br>
			To hurry her into the shower again <br>
			<br>
			And you know she's gonna be alright <br>
			<br>
			She's on the phone with all her friends<br>
			The conversation never ends<br>
			She's got the stories people love to hear <br>
			And you know she's gonna be alright <br>
			<br>
			Cleaning up the house today<br>
			She runs across some of his old things<br>
			She realizes why it never worked <br>
			<br>
			And you know she's gonna be just fine<br>
			And you know she's gonna be alright<br>
			And you know she's gonna be just fine<br>
			And you know she's alright.<br>

			Hey, don't write me off just yet<br>

			Now I'm sailing through the air<br>
			No one has to trust me here<br>
			Nothing is a could have been<br>
			Nowhere safe for me to land<br>

			Hurtling on my return<br>
			When my body touches down<br>
			A million pieces on the ground.<br>

			Oh the bright ideas<br>
			In the dark when you feel oh so cold <br>

			Breathing in fumes<br>
			Embalming while I sew<br>
			And her skin looks so pretty down below<br>
			Oh the bright ideas<br>
			In the dark when you feel oh so cold <br>
			<br>
			Oh I tried to fight<br>

Like all the dead leaves when fall comes<br>
Why should you believe me now?<br>
When you're running in circles crusading and fleeing love

You were the young once<br>
Love devotees on trampolines

And it does no good <br>
Even when it’s understood,<br>
It will remain and there isn’t a way to get it all out
</p>
<p>
Every single breath <br>
Making you more upset,<br>
Shutting it down is the way that you’ve found to prolong this slow death,<br>

Somehow you don’t move on,<br>

And it does no good<br>
Even when it’s understood,<br>
Always the same you can’t think of a way to get it all out,

All of the things that we had<br>
They just faded away too soon,<br>

<p>
All the venom that is spit off-handedly,<br>
A poison seeping slowly into the heart,<br>
And it’s overwhelming everything around us,<br>
Sets the teeth on edge as it slowly tears us apart,
</p>
<p>
I thought you should know.
</p>
<p>
All of the things that we had<br>
They just faded away too soon,<br>

We don’t pull through.<br>
Don’t’ know if you ever think about it<br>

  (Is it all you need?) </p>
<p> What do you do when it fades to nothing? <br>
  You’re getting sore from sitting tight. <br>
  Do you wait for another connection? <br>
  It starts to kill you just to toe the line. <br>
  It’s gonna kill you just to toe the line.</p>
  
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="thespacebetweenus"></a>The Space Between Us</span></p>
<p>We knock on doors,<br>
  When no one’s home,<br>
  No cars and the yard is overgrown,</p>
<p>So we break in,<br>
  Out of the cold,<br>
  Desperate for warmth in the unknown,</p>
<p>And all those times rushing by,<br>
  From here to infinity,</p>
<p>Swept out into the night,<br>
  And they never come back again,</p>
<p>Take up arms choose your sides,<br>
  We had this feeling years ago,</p>
<p>No way across the divide,<br>
  It’s only space between us now.</p>
<p>And now it’s gone,<br>
  Away from here,<br>
  Lost and found,<br>
  in faded years.</p>
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="whatliesahead"></a>What Lies Ahead</span></p>
<p>She floats away now<br>
  She's down to bed<br>
  Wish I could keep you<br>
  From the lies ahead</p>
<p>Just mind your head<br>
  Please don't forget<br>
  To shine light ahead<br>
  On the lies ahead</p>
<p>What lies ahead<br>
  What lies ahead<br>
  The lies ahead<br>
  Use light instead</p>
  
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="exorcisingyourghost"></a>Exorcising Your Ghost</span></p>
<p>In the night listening to you exhale,<br>
  Lying beside you satisfied,</p>
<p>It’s a dream<br>
  I’m trapped and there's no way out,<br>
  Lost within endless doubt,<br>
  So lost,</p>
<p>And there’s no point to get out,<br>
  Nothing gained, going without,<br>
  And I’m still waiting for the day when<br>
  I wake up and I’m living.</p>
<p>Yeah I know,<br>
  That’s what kills me the most:<br>
  Exorcising your ghost for good</p>
<p>And there’s no point to set out,<br>
  Nothing gained, going without,<br>
  And I’m still waiting for the day when<br>
  I wake up and I’m living.</p>
<p>And so what does it get you<br>
  When you take away everything and you’re left alone?</p>
<p>Would it kill you<br>
  If you were to make believe that you could still feel love?</p>
<p>Would it upset you?<br>
  If I take away everything and it’s set in stone?</p>
<p>Would it kill you?<br>
  If you were to make believe that you could still be loved?</p>
  
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="rewritethestory"></a>Rewrite the Story</span></p>
<p>So far,<br>
  Gliding along without intention,</p>
<p>Long gone,<br>
  Blown by the breeze,<br>
  Fields will lie fallow</p>
<p>Oh you don’t pay attention,<br>
  That’s how you end up beat down,<br>
  Sands slipping through,<br>
  Waiting forever,</p>
<p>Don’t mind years passing by<br>
  No time to notice</p>
<p>And find<br>
  You don’t know how to rewrite the story</p>
<p>Oh you don’t pay attention,<br>
  That’s how you end up beat down,</p>
<p>Floating away in space,<br>
  No longer out of place,<br>
  No longer feel the pull,<br>
  Vanish without a trace,</p>
<p>And now it’s set ablaze,<br>
  Nothing to hold you,</p>
<p>Downwind,<br>
  The first place you land won’t be the last one</p>
<p>Oh you don’t pay attention<br>
  To what you commit to,<br>
  Tied down,<br>
  Frozen by fear,<br>
  Waiting forever.</p>
  
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="theregoesmylove"></a>There Goes My Love</span></p>
<p>Hate comes after denial<br>
  And slowly eats into your head<br>
  And you lose blood in your veins<br>
  You're running out of love</p>
<p>It's so long and you're done<br>
  It's so long now you've gone<br>
  Right back out in two</p>
<p>There goes my love<br>
  You know it couldn't wait<br>
  Take everything when you leave now<br>
  Broken by love<br>
  I know you couldn't wait<br>
  Make believe it's ok now</p>
<p>I hate I fell for you<br>
  I doubt you ever knew<br>
  That I could feel<br>
  Up and down your spine<br>
  When all of your measured love withdrew</p>
<p>It's so long and you're done<br>
  It's so long now you've gone<br>
  Right back out in two</p>
<p>There goes my love<br>
  You know it couldn't wait<br>
  Take everything when you leave now<br>
  Broken by love<br>
  I know you couldn't wait<br>
  Make believe it's ok now</p>
<p>Yeah it's a light<br>
  A light inside the walls surrounding you</p>
  
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="runningthedistance"></a>Running the Distance</span></p>
<p>Looking afield for reasons to let go,<br>
  Alone at the wheel,<br>
  Distance yourself from me,</p>
<p>Caught in the breeze, <br>
  a kite in a tree,<br>
  Unable to leave,<br>
  Tangled up all the while,</p>
<p>All the stars are gone,<br>
  You waited all night long but you don’t see anything</p>
<p>Running the distance,<br>
  I’m never able to keep stride,</p>
<p>Left it for dead,<br>
  Buried at sea,<br>
  Spiraling down,<br>
  A ship run aground in the tide,</p>
<p>Caught in the breeze, <br>
  a kite in a tree,<br>
  Unable to leave,<br>
  Tangled up all the while,</p>
<p>All the stars are gone,<br>
  You waited all night long but you don’t see anything,<br>
  That’s no lazy eye,<br>
  looking for the reasons why we lost everything</p>
  
<p>Running the distance<br>
  I’m never able to keep stride.</p>
  
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="noonecantouchyounow"></a>No one can touch you now</span></p>
<p>Running through your disappearing act,<br>
  Somehow I feel I have to persist,<br>
  In bringing all the history back,<br>
  You make sure I no longer exist,</p>
<p>Where’d you go to?<br>
  No one can touch you now.</p>
<p>Silence is the natural refrain,<br>
  It’s the only possible response,<br>
  Frozen from that ice in your veins,<br>
  That you refuse to ever let defrost,</p>
<p>Where’d you go to?<br>
  No one can touch you now.</p>
<p>All you withdrew,<br>
  All you don’t have now.</p>
  
<p><span class="emphasis"><a name="jumpingthetracks"></a>Jumping the Tracks</span></p>
<p>Hey,<br>
  Should we take a holiday<br>
  From being blown away?<br>
  Cuz it’s always too late to start,<br>
  when you feel you’ll be torn apart,<br>
  Yeah you know we’ll be torn apart,</p>
<p>So we stand our ground and wait,<br>
  For the apathy to take,<br>
  One more day to feel less alive,<br>
  Statuesque and crumbling inside,<br>
  Yeah you know so gone all the while,</p>
<p>Hey, <br>
  Gonna hide that heart away, (all the way to the end)<br>
  Cuz we need that holiday,<br>
  Don’t you feel we’re not coming back? (all the way to the end)<br>
  Once we’re gone there’s no coming back,<br>
  Yeah you know we’re jumping the tracks.</p>
<p>We’re colliding yet we’re splitting in two,<br>
  But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,<br>
  No way to keep us on.</p>
<p>Wait,<br>
  Don’t you take that all away,<br>
  Like you’ll never be OK,<br>
  Cuz it’s too late to get it back,<br>
  Once we’re gone there’s no coming back,<br>
  Oh you know we’re jumping the tracks.</p>
<p>We’re colliding yet we’re splitting in two,<br>
  But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,<br>
  No way to keep us on,<br>
  And we’re slowly fading into the blue,<br>
  But we’re so numb we don’t feel what to do,<br>
  No way to keep us on.</p>

<p>Lately I've been a cauldron<br>
  You should leave when all of the steam builds<br>
  And my lid goes flying off<br>
  When it rains down on us</p>
<p>Laying under shady tree<br>
  Should calm your frayed nerves<br>
  But it creeps into each of your veins<br>
  And all of your blood begins to boil</p>
<p>Then it's raining on us<br>
  Boiling rain down on us<br>
  Acrid rain on us<br>
  Leaves a stain on us</p>
<p>Lately I've been a cauldron<br>
  Slowing stewing on low</p>
