the video for the <em>"steal the blueprints"</em> is once again being screened... or should i say twice again.  the first time will be at the <a href="http://www.sdaff.org/">7th annual San Diego Asian American Film Festival</a>. the second will be at the <a href="http://www.hiff.org/">Louis Vuitton Hawaii International Film Festival</a> which sounds very fancy.

last but not least - <a href="http://www.three21media.com/">Three21 Media</a>'s video for <em>"i've been lost"</em> took home top honors at the <a href="http://www.aaiff.org/">29th New York Asian American International Film Festival</a>. <br>

we now have lots of new and exciting things - mainly, in <a href="./pictures.html">pics</a> you can find a number of audio tracks including a couple previews of the new record.  additionally, you'll find some other songs, and all of the videos made for our songs.  you also get to see what we look like and what we eat... and you are what you eat, so really it's like all pictures of us...<br><br>
speaking of which, don't forget about the screenings of <em>"steal the blueprints"</em> at the <a href="http://www.sdaff.org/">7th annual San Diego Asian American Film Festival</a> on october 14 and 15 and also at the <a href="http://www.hiff.org/">Louis Vuitton Hawaii International Film Festival</a> sometime between october 19 and 29 (how's that for exact). check em out!<br><br>
